//! Registering a program to start when the user logs in.
//!
//! Every host has a mechanism for this and no two agree on what it is called,
//! where it is stored, or what it is written in: a systemd user unit, a
//! launchd agent plist, a Task Scheduler ONLOGON task. A caller has one
//! question -- start this program at login, and stop doing so -- and answering
//! it should not require knowing which of the three is in play.
//!
//! What stays with the caller is *enrolment*: whether to register at all, what
//! the thing is called, and which program runs. Those arrive in
//! [`AutostartProgram`].
