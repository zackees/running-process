# Running Process Refactoring Analysis

## Current Implementation Analysis

### dump_stack_trace() - ✅ COMPLETED
~~Currently implemented as a hardcoded GDB-based stack dump in `RunningProcess.dump_stack_trace()` at running_process.py:345. **This approach is too rigid** - different users need different debugging approaches (GDB, pstack, custom profilers, etc.).~~

✅ **REFACTORED**: Removed the hardcoded `dump_stack_trace()` method and replaced with flexible callback-based system.

### _handle_timeout() - ✅ COMPLETED
~~This function (running_process.py:393) currently has hardcoded stack trace dumping logic. **Should be refactored** to accept a user-provided timeout callback instead of the boolean `enable_stack_trace` flag.~~

✅ **REFACTORED**: Now accepts user-provided `on_timeout` callback instead of boolean flag. Timeout handlers receive `ProcessInfo` context.

## Architecture Questions Answered

### How does it enforce easy stdout reading?
- **ProcessOutputReader**: Dedicated threaded reader (line 35) that drains stdout to prevent blocking
- **Queue-based streaming**: Non-blocking `get_next_line()` and `get_next_line_non_blocking()` methods
- **Iterator interface**: `line_iter()` provides context-managed iteration over output lines
- **Accumulated output**: All output stored in `accumulated_output` list for later retrieval via `.stdout` property

### How does it enforce easy timeout protection?
- **Dual timeout enforcement**: Both global process timeout and per-line timeout support
- **ProcessWatcher**: Independent background watcher thread that enforces timeouts even if main thread is blocked
- **Configurable timeouts**: Instance-level timeout + method-level timeout override in `wait()`
- **Timeout actions**: Automatic process killing and optional stack trace dumping

### How does it enforce easy stack trace dumping? - ✅ IMPLEMENTED
✅ **Callback-based timeout handling implemented**: Users now provide their own debugging logic:
- **Custom timeout handlers**: Users supply their own debugging callback (GDB, pstack, custom profilers)
- **Flexible debugging**: Each user can implement debugging appropriate for their environment
- **Process context provided**: Timeout callback receives `ProcessInfo` object with (PID, command, duration)
- **Thread-safe**: Callback executed from timeout detection thread
- **No hardcoded dependencies**: Removed rigid GDB-only approach

### How does it enforce easy process tree termination?
- **process_utils.kill_process_tree()**: Uses psutil to recursively terminate all child processes
- **Graceful then forceful**: First attempts SIGTERM, then SIGKILL after timeout
- **Integrated into kill()**: Called automatically from `RunningProcess.kill()` method

### How does it enforce easy process tree killing?
- **Built into kill() method**: Line 863 calls `kill_process_tree(self.proc.pid)`
- **Prevents orphans**: Ensures no child processes remain after parent termination
- **Exception handling**: Graceful fallback to simple kill if tree kill fails

### How does it prevent orphaned processes?
- **Process tree killing**: `kill_process_tree()` kills all children recursively
- **Registration system**: `RunningProcessManager` tracks all active processes
- **Cleanup on exit**: Ensures all processes are terminated on shutdown
- **Signal handling**: Keyboard interrupts propagate to kill process trees

### How does it handle keyboard interrupts?
- **Thread-safe interrupts**: `_thread.interrupt_main()` propagates interrupts from worker threads
- **ProcessOutputReader**: Catches KeyboardInterrupt and terminates process (line 143)
- **ProcessWatcher**: Handles interrupts in watcher thread (line 211)
- **Graceful cleanup**: Interrupts trigger proper process termination

### How does it handle process completion?
- **Multiple detection paths**: `poll()`, `wait()`, and reader thread all detect completion
- **Callback system**: `on_complete` callback executed on normal completion
- **Thread synchronization**: Reader thread signals completion via `_on_reader_end` callback
- **Cleanup coordination**: `_notify_terminated()` ensures single cleanup execution

### How does it prevent hanging?
- **Non-blocking queues**: Output queue with timeout-based access prevents blocking
- **Thread-based pumping**: ProcessOutputReader continuously drains stdout
- **Timeout enforcement**: Multiple timeout mechanisms prevent indefinite waits
- **Process watching**: Independent watcher thread ensures processes don't hang

### How does it allow deferred handling of printing of stdout streams?
- **Output formatters**: `OutputFormatter` protocol allows custom output transformation
- **Separated concerns**: Reading/queuing separate from printing/display
- **Echo mode**: `wait(echo=True)` provides deferred printing during wait
- **Accumulated storage**: All output stored for later access via `.stdout` property

## Ideal API Design

Based on the analysis, the current API is well-designed but could benefit from these enhancements:

```python
# Custom timeout handler for GDB stack dumping
def gdb_timeout_handler(process_info):
    """Custom timeout handler that uses GDB for stack traces."""
    pid = process_info.pid
    command = process_info.command
    duration = process_info.duration

    print(f"Process {pid} ({command}) timed out after {duration}s")
    # User implements their preferred debugging approach
    gdb_output = subprocess.run([
        "gdb", "-batch", "-ex", f"attach {pid}",
        "-ex", "bt", "-ex", "detach"
    ], capture_output=True, text=True)
    print("Stack trace:", gdb_output.stdout)

# Core process execution with callback-based timeout handling
process = RunningProcess(
    command=["python", "script.py"],
    timeout=30,                    # Global timeout
    on_timeout=gdb_timeout_handler, # User-provided timeout handler
    on_complete=lambda: print("Done!")  # Completion callback
)

# Easy stdout consumption patterns
for line in process.line_iter(timeout=1.0):  # Per-line timeout
    print(f"Output: {line}")

# Non-blocking polling
while not process.finished:
    line = process.get_next_line_non_blocking()
    if line:
        handle_output(line)
    time.sleep(0.1)

# Immediate access to all output
process.wait()
print(process.stdout)  # All accumulated output

# Advanced: Custom output formatting
class JSONFormatter(OutputFormatter):
    def transform(self, line: str) -> str:
        return json.dumps({"timestamp": time.time(), "output": line})

# Built-in time delta formatter for timing analysis
from running_process import TimeDeltaFormatter

process = RunningProcess(
    command=["make", "build"],
    output_formatter=TimeDeltaFormatter(),  # Prefixes lines with "[1.23] output"
    timeout=300
)

# Custom formatter with JSON output
process = RunningProcess(
    command=["pytest", "tests/"],
    output_formatter=JSONFormatter(),
    timeout=300
)

# Alternative timeout handlers for different needs
def pstack_timeout_handler(process_info):
    """Alternative timeout handler using pstack (Solaris/Linux)."""
    subprocess.run(["pstack", str(process_info.pid)])

def custom_profiler_handler(process_info):
    """Custom timeout handler with application-specific profiling."""
    # Send SIGUSR1 to trigger application's built-in profiling
    os.kill(process_info.pid, signal.SIGUSR1)
    print(f"Sent profiling signal to {process_info.command}")

# Simplified subprocess.run() replacement with callback support
result = subprocess_run(
    command=["git", "status"],
    cwd=Path("/project"),
    timeout=10,
    check=True,
    on_timeout=None  # No timeout debugging needed for simple commands
)
print(result.stdout)

# The new API is now implemented and ready for use!
```

## Recommended API Improvements

1. ✅ **Replace hardcoded stack tracing with callback system**: ~~Remove `enable_stack_trace` boolean and `dump_stack_trace()` method. Add `on_timeout` callback parameter that receives process context.~~ **COMPLETED**

2. **Add process events system**: Observable events for start, output, timeout, completion

3. **Enhance output formatters**: ✅ Added TimeDeltaFormatter for timing analysis. Consider additional built-in formatters (JSON, colored output)

4. **Process groups**: Manage multiple related processes as a unit

5. **Streaming to files**: Direct output streaming to files without memory accumulation

6. **Better keyboard interrupt handling**: More granular control over interrupt behavior

## Refactoring Status

✅ **COMPLETED**: The hardcoded GDB stack trace system has been successfully replaced with the callback-based approach. This removes inflexible debugging code and gives users full control over timeout handling while maintaining the robust timeout detection infrastructure.

### Code Quality Improvements - ✅ COMPLETED

**Method Complexity Reduction**: Successfully broke down high-complexity methods identified in CLAUDE.md:
- ✅ **ProcessOutputReader.run()**: Split into `_run_with_error_handling()` and `_perform_final_cleanup()`
- ✅ **RunningProcess.get_next_line()**: Extracted `_check_timeout_expired()` and `_wait_for_output_or_completion()`
- ✅ **RunningProcess.wait()**: Extracted multiple helper methods (`_validate_process_started()`, `_determine_effective_timeout()`, etc.)

## Implementation Notes

### Command Validation
✅ **Implemented**: RunningProcess now validates that string commands require `shell=True`. This prevents common errors where users pass string commands with `shell=False`.

```python
# This will raise ValueError
RunningProcess("python script.py", shell=False)  # ERROR

# These are valid
RunningProcess("python script.py", shell=True)   # OK
RunningProcess(["python", "script.py"])          # OK, shell auto-detected as False
```

### TimeDeltaFormatter
✅ **Implemented**: New built-in formatter that prefixes each output line with elapsed time since process start in format `[1.23] output`. Useful for performance analysis and debugging timing issues.
