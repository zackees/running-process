//! What this host says about running out of things.
//!
//! A caller that fails to open a socket or write a file needs to know *which*
//! wall it hit -- descriptors, or space -- because the two call for different
//! responses: shed load and retry, or stop and free something. The number the
//! host returns to say so is different on each of them, and in the Windows
//! case there are three numbers rather than one.
//!
//! So the classification lives here and the response stays with the caller.
//! Nothing in these signatures names an errno or a Win32 code.
